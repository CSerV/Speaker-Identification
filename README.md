# Speaker-Identification
This is a program to train a deep neural network for the task of speaker identification.

The program depends on the following installations :-
	1) TensorFlow or Theano (backend for Keras)
	2) Keras
	3) Scipy
	4) Numpy
	5) Scikit-learn
	6) Mlpy
	7) Scikits.talkbox

There are two modes to run the program :-
	1) Making changes in code itself for specifying training and testing data - runMode_1.py
	2) Using command line arguments for specifying training and testing data - runMode_2.py
